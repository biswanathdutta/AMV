# AMV: Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary (AMV) 

Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary is a vocabulary for capturing and storing the metadata about the algorithms (a procedure or a set of rules that is followed step-by-step to solve a problem, especially by a computer). There are uncountable algorithms present in every area (e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics), which makes it hard for specialists, academicians, application engineers, and so forth to discover, distinguish, select, and reuse them. The snag faced by the researchers in the current time is the failure of getting relevant results when searching for algorithms in any search engine. AMV is represented as a semantic model and produced OWL file, which can be directly used by anyone interested to create and publish algorithm metadata as a knowledge graph, or to provide metadata service through SPARQL endpoint. The vocabulary may also be used to annotate the literature (e.g., research article, monographs, dissertation, technical reports) providing the algorithms.

## Algorithm Knowledge Graph 

Using the designed AMV vocabulary, a knowledge graph has been produced as available from this page (see the above list). 
This kG is produced automatically by extracting the data from the Stony Brook Algorithm Repository. The KG is based on 75 algorithmic problems available from the repository. The KG consists of in total 59 classes, 44 object properties, 50 data properties, 1494 individuals, and 9706 axioms. 


### Python Code 
The software (Python code) that we built to extract the data from the Stony Brook Algorithm Repository is made available here (see above for the code).
