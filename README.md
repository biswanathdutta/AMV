Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary (AMV) 

Algorithm Metadata Vocabulary is a vocabulary for capturing and storing the metadata about the algorithms (a procedure or a set of rules that is followed step-by-step to solve a problem, especially by a computer). There are uncountable algorithms present in every area (e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics), which makes it hard for specialists, academicians, application engineers, and so forth to discover, distinguish, select, and reuse them. The snag faced by the researchers in the current time is the failure of getting relevant results when searching for algorithms in any search engine. AMV is represented as a semantic model and produced OWL file, which can be directly used by anyone interested to create and publish algorithm metadata as a knowledge graph, or to provide metadata service through SPARQL endpoint. The vocabulary may also be used to annotate the literature (e.g., research article, monographs, dissertation, technical reports) providing the algorithms.
